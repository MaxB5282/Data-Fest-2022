# Data-Fest-2022
Code and datafiles for Data Fest 2022

The Data Fest file is a Jupyter notebook using Python for Data exploration and analysis

The two csv files are samples of what kind of data was collected. The full file of all students is about 1.3 GB, so the smaller files will have to do for this repo.
